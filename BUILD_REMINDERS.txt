Before building this mod, REMEMBER TO DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Add the following dependency to "fabric.mod.json," which MUST be removed after the .jar file is built:

"immersive_portals": ">=2.2.5"

2. Change the mod's version number if necessary
3. Remove unnecessary library imports from modified class files
4. Review to-do items to make sure nothing is being missed
5. CHANGELOG.md must be updated for publishing purposes!

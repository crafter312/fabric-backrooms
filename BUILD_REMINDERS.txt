Before building this mod, REMEMBER TO DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Add the following dependency to "fabric.mod.json," which MUST be removed after the .jar file is built:

    "immersive_portals": ">=2.7.3",

2. Change the mod's version number if necessary
3. Remove unnecessary library imports from modified class files
4. Review to-do items to make sure nothing is being missed
5. CHANGELOG.md must be updated for publishing purposes!

To use the latest version of a GitHub repository as a dependency instead of a release version:

1. In Intellij, create a new project: New -> Project from Version Control...
2. Paste the HTTPS link from the relevant GitHub repository in the URL box, which looks like this:

https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn.git

3. Click the 'Clone' button and wait for the project setup to finish
4. Once the project setup is finished, run the two following commands in the Terminal window:

./gradlew runDatagen
./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal

5. The latter of the two above commands generates a local Maven repository in the following folder:

C:\Users\[USER NAME HERE]\.m2\repository\

6. In your build.gradle file, add mavelLocal() at the TOP of your repositories list
7. Add the dependency to your dependencies list, like the following example:

modImplementation "TechReborn:TechReborn-unknown:5.5.0+local"

The above example is essentially a file path, starting from inside the .m2/repository/ directory and
ending with whatever subdirectory contains the relevant .jar, .module, and .pom files.

8. Use the above dependency only for development and testing! When publishing a version of your mod,
   don't forget to replace it with a release version of the relevant dependency.
